# correlomics
Pipeline for uncovering microRNA editing and structural features based on reference and sequencing data

Features to add:
- make a sensible file structure
- make it snakemake compatible
- package directory only contain required code, no data
- input data to be specified with YAML file
- use virtualenv not conda (figure out how to make this work with snakemake)
